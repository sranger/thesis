			Selection
		</h3>
		<p class="P3"> </p>
		<p class="P4">Point selection is based on a number of different
			algorithms tailored for use with the LiDAR point cloud. Initially, I
			attempted to use the CAST algorithm directly by computing a marching
			cubes solution from a screen-space lasso selection, removing any
			cells with low density, and returning the result but it became clear
			that the marching cubes algorithm was difficult to apply as what
			portion of the cubes to mark below or above the surface was
			complicated. So, applying the screen-space lasso selection into a
			more generic form was done. </p>
		<p class="P4"> </p>
		<p class="P4">First, the screen-space lasso selection is applied by the
			user control+clicking the mouse and dragging to define the lasso
			shape. This shape is automatically closed to create a polygon or, if
			the lasso overlaps, truncated where first it crossed itself. Then,
			this screen-space lasso is projected into the scene and a three
			dimensional frustum is created. Frustum culling is done just as it is
			when rendering the scene and any points that fall within the lasso
			frustum are returned. Then, an eigenvector-based orthonormal is
			computed for the dataset and a general plane direction is stored. for
			each point that had been selected a number of algorithms are applied
			(all user-toggleable and orderable). </p>
		<p class="P4">
			The first algorithm,
			<span class="T2">Pruning Altitude,</span>
			is a simple altitude mask is applied by computing the min/max
			altitude range of the selected points. Any point whose altitude is
			below a percentage of the total altitude range is removed.
		</p>
		<p class="P4">
			The second algorithm,
			<span class="T2">Pruning </span>
			Orthonormal, first computes the k-nearest neighbors of every point
			and any point where its furthest neighbor is greater than the maximum
			cell distance away is discarded; this is done so that small groupings
			of points away from the major clump. Then, the eigenvector normal is
			computed for each point based on its nearest neighbors and if that
			<span class="T2">vector is within a user-definable threshold of the
				global orthonormal vector (1.0 is parallel and facing the same
				direction, -1.0 is parallel and facing away, 0.0 is perpendicular;
				the dot product result) then the point is removed.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="P5">The last algorithm, Pruning Obstruction, was taken from the
			second paper used (Screen-Space Operators) and computes point
			obstructions between the camera location and every point in the
			selection. If any other point is closer than the current point and
			within a user-definable angle threshold, that point is discarded as
			it is obstructed from view.</p>
		<p class="P5">Finally, the remaining points are returned by the pruning
			function and stored in a collection for export. If selection
			rendering is enabled, the points are rendered in the scene alongside
			the point cloud (but as white and with a larger point size) and/or
			sent to be triangulated. The triangulation algorithm takes the pruned
			subset of the selection and computes the eigenvector normal of them
			all. Then, each point is projected onto the plane defined by this
			normal and the center point of the selection’s cartesian bounds; a
			mapping is kept from the two-dimensional point to the original point
			cloud value. Then, the two-dimensional points are passed to a
			Delaunay triangulation class and triangulated. The resulting triangle
			mesh is converted back into XYZ cartesian space by swapping the
			points in the triangulation with the mappings from the point cloud
			and sent to the rendering system for export by the user. If triangle
			display is enabled, the triangulated points are rendered alongside
			the point cloud data.</p>
