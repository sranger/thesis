Master of Science Thesis

This is the main body of source code written to fulfill my Masters of Science at the Rochester Institute of Technology in 2016.

It is a library that contains an Java-based OpenGL framework for rendering a 3D World, Massive Point Cloud rendering system, and other associated components.

The main goal of my thesis was to compare a common octree-based data storage scheme for use with rendering massive point clouds in real time with an icosahedron variant (Icosatree as I called it).

The written thesis can be found within the docs/final directory.
